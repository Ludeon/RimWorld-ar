"An ancient targeting apparatus for an orbital bombardment system. This unit "
"designates a target and transmits the coordinates to a network of "
"satellites, which then bombard the target area with kinetic impactors. This "
"unit has been reprogrammed to accept unauthorized users, but once it is "
"used, the network will detect the incursion and cut off the link "
"permanently."

"An ancient targeting unit for a network of power-collection satellites. Once"
" aimed at a target, it directs ancient satellites to begin beaming power "
"down in a massive column of electromagnetic energy. This power can safely be"
" collected in a giant absorption dish. Since you have no absorption dish, "
"you'll be aiming it at enemies, at which point the power column will turn "
"the area into a thousand-degree inferno. This will last until the satellites"
" detect the unsafe targeting, shut themselves down, and permanently "
"deactivate the targeter."

"An ancient control unit for a network of weather-control satellites. This "
"device has had certain failsafes bypassed; it is capable of causing a "
"massive air current disturbance, which will generate a tornado at a chosen "
"location. The weather network will detect this unauthorized intrusion and "
"lock out the device after use, but the tornado will be left to spend its "
"energy normally."
