"A concoction of mechanites that dramatically improve the body's functioning "
"in all respects. Over time, it can even heal old scarred-over wounds or "
"brain damage, though it cannot regenerate lost limbs. Unfortunately, without"
" the moderating effects of regular doses every five or six days, the "
"mechanites lose cohesion, causing continuous berserk rages and, eventually, "
"death.\\n\\nAfter the first dose, there is no way to get the mechanites out,"
" ever.\\n\\nOn the urbworlds, they call Luciferium the 'Devil's Bargain'. "
"Many have been forced to kill friends when no more of the seductive red "
"pills could be found."
