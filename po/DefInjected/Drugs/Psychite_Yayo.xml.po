"A refined powdery preparation of the psychite drug. When snorted, it "
"produces a rapid euphoric high, dramatically reduces the user's need for "
"rest, and suppresses pain. Like all forms of psychite, it is addictive, "
"though it is not as addictive as the cruder flake.\\n\\nBecause of its high "
"cost and refined appearance, many cultures associate yayo with degenerate "
"wealth. Whether in the throneroom or the boardroom, many hare-brained policy"
" schemes have been developed during yayo-fueled binge parties."
