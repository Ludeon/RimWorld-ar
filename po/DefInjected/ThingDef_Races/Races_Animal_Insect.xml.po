"A large, genetically-engineered beetle. Once the worker caste of an "
"artificial ecosystem of insectoids designed to fight mechanoid invasions, it"
" is now often seen without its deadlier insectoid cousins. Still, its size "
"and hard shell make it dangerous when it attacks. A eusocial creature, it "
"cannot reproduce individually."
