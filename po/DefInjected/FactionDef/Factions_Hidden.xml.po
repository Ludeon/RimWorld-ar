"Killer machines of unknown origin. Hidden in ancient structures, under "
"mounds of dust, or at the bottom of the ocean, mechanoids can self-maintain "
"for thousands of years. This group of mechs seems to be unified in purpose, "
"but not well-coordinated in action. While local scholars believe they're "
"autonomous weapons left over from an ancient war, tribal legends describe "
"them as the demonic servants of a sleeping god."

"These giant insect-like creatures live underground and burrow up to attack "
"when attracted by noise or pheromone signals. Originally from the planet "
"Sorne, interstellar entrepreneurs managed to capture, genetically-modify, "
"and vat-grow the insect colonies for use as weapons. It's not clear who "
"placed Sorne insects on this planet, but they are here and as dangerous as "
"ever."
