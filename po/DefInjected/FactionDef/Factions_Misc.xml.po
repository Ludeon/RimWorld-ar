"A loose confederation of pirate gangs who've agreed to mostly fight "
"outsiders instead of fighting each other.\\n\\nPirates don't sow, they don't"
" build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that "
"values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding"
" and robbing their more productive neighbors.\\n\\nTheir technology level "
"depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. Mostly they "
"carry gunpowder weapons, though some prefer to stab victims at close range."
