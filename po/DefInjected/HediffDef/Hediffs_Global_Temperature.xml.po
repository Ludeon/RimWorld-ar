"A special biological state used by some creatures to survive extreme cold. "
"Instead of trying to stay warm, the creature's body chemistry adapts to "
"prevent internal freezing despite very low temperature. Bodily functions are"
" slowed and capacities are reduced, but the cold does no permanent damage. "
"Some biologists call it a wakeful form of hibernation."
