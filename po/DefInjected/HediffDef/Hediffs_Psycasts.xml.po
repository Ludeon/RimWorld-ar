"An organic connection to a larger psychic field. This allows a person to "
"psychically induce a distant archotech superintelligence to influence "
"reality in ways that seem impossible.\\n\\nHigher levels of psylink permit "
"the use of more powers. Regardless of psylink level, a person can only use "
"specific powers that they have learned.\\n\\nPsylink comes from a variety of"
" sources. Single-use psylink neuroformer devices can create a psylink. "
"Tribal peoples also know how to develop it through ritual linking with the "
"legendary anima tree.\\n\\nAs a physical phenomenon in the brain, psylink is"
" poorly-understood by scientists, not least because it seems to actively "
"conceal itself if studied too closely. One thing most agree on is that it "
"somehow connects people to archotechs and harnesses their power, possibly "
"through some sort of negotiation or sympathy mechanism."
