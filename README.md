## Contributing

Read [official contribution guidelines](http://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=2933.0) before you start work on this project.

However, the contribution workflow is different for this project. 

1. Setup your computer for translation:
    1. [Download the files in this repository using GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop#creating-a-branch).
    1. [Create a new branch to work from](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop#creating-a-branch), based on `master`. This will be needed for submitting your changes and generating the game files for testing.
    1. Download [POEdit](https://poedit.net/download). This is a free and easy application we use for translating files.
1. Start translating:
    1. Open files in the `po/` folder using POEdit.
    1. Fill out any entries that are empty or marked as `Needs Work`.
<!-- TODO -->
<!-- 1. Test your translations: -->
1. Submit your work:
    1. Upload any changed files through GitHub Desktop by [creating a new pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop#creating-a-branch).
        * **Do NOT commit to the `master` branch directly!** The `master` branch is a clean, working copy of the project.
        * Do not commit any files outside of the `po/` folder, unless you have a reason for including them.
    1. A maintainer of the project will review the changes. If everything looks good, they will approve the changes and merge them into `master`. They will then be available in the `Arabic/` folder for use in the game.
