## Contributing

Read [official contribution guidelines](http://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=2933.0) before you start work on this project.

However, the contribution workflow is different for this project. 

1. Download the files in this repository using GitHub Desktop, by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop). If you're familiar with Git, clone the repository however you like.
    * There are two main folders: `po` and `Arabic`. `po` contains the files we use to translate. `Arabic` contains the game files and is automatically generated here in GitHub.
1. Download the software [POEdit](https://poedit.net/download). This is the main software we use for translating files.
1. Open files in the `po/` folder, and fill out any entries that are empty or marked as `Needs Work`. 
1. Upload any changed files through GitHub Desktop by creating a new pull request. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=desktop).
    * **Do NOT commit to the `master` branch directly!** The `master` branch is a clean, working copy of the project.
    * Do not commit any files outside of the `po/` folder, unless you have a reason for including them.
