RimWorld-ar
===========

This is the Arabic localization project for [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/).

See [this page](http://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=2933.0) for instructions on how this works, as well as licence information.

# Rules

* Please do not commit or pull-request to the `master` branch directly! This is to keep a clean, working copy of the project. There will be a branch for every major release, and other branches can be used as necessary.

* Read [this post](http://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=2933.0) before you start work on this project. You really should. You can also check out the [German localization repo](https://github.com/Ludeon/RimWorld-de) to see an example of a good project.
